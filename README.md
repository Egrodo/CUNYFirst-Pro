Adds useful features to the CUNYFirst class selection website.
CUNYFirst Pro adds useful features to the CUNYFirst website and class selection process in attempt to make the terrible site just slightly better.

Features include:
   - Saving your school selection so you don't have to click "Baruch College" every single time you search for classes.
   - Displaying each professors "Rate My Professor" rating next to their name in the search results list for easy comparison.
   - Showing a friendly popup upon clicking "See Reviews" that allows you to preview the reviews for any given professor, without leaving the site!
   - Uses a background script to cache reviews and ratings for a faster user experience.
   - Gathers absolutely zero information on you and is completely open source (https://github.com/Egrodo/CUNYFirst-Pro)
